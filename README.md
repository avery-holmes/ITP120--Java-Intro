# ITP120 - Java Intro

This repository contains my coursework and personal learning progress for **ITP 120 - Java Programming I**, part of my path toward transitioning into a professional Software Engineering role.

## üìö About the Course

ITP 120 is an introductory Java programming course covering:

- Java syntax and basic program structure
- Variables and data types
- Operators and expressions
- String class and text processing
- Arithmetic and logical operations
- Keyboard input and output (Scanner class)
- Control flow basics (if, switch, loops ‚Äî later modules)
- Object-oriented programming fundamentals (later modules)
- Program structure and modularization
- Best practices in coding style and comments

## üöÄ Why This Repo

As part of my professional transition from **Lead Risk Associate** into a **Software Engineering** role, I am documenting my progress through formal coursework and self-study.

This repository:

‚úÖ Tracks my hands-on coding practice  
‚úÖ Demonstrates my learning over time  
‚úÖ Serves as a public portfolio for future SWE job applications
